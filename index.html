      <p>Thanks for visiting this site! Hope you like it!</p>
      <p>Paul Scholes is my favorite football player. His footballing skills are undoubtedly top notch, yet off the pitch he stays a humble human being. He's simply in this game to play football. Both as a football player and a human being, he is clearly one of the best.</p>
      <p>I'm not a man with words, so I hope I'm doing this tribute site justice. If you have any suggestions or feedbacks for this site, email me at <a href="&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#98;&#101;&#110;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#107;&#115;&#48;&#52;&#48;&#56;&#56;&#56;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#98;&#101;&#110;&#104;&#97;&#110;&#107;&#115;&#48;&#52;&#48;&#56;&#56;&#56;&#64;&#103;&#109;&#97;&#105;&#108;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a>. I would really love to hear from you.</p>

      <h1>Thank You Paul Scholes!</h1>
      <p><span class="dropcap">&ldquo;I</span> love football, have done since I first started kicking a ball as a boy. But I am not interested in the things that go with it. For me, it is about the game, the pleasure of striking a ball or finding the right pass. It is not about having my name up in lights.&rdquo;</p>

      <p>That single quote describes just about everything there is to know, and you need to know, about how great Paul Scholes is. Ending his brilliant 19 years of career is definitely not easy for a player who is in love in the game so much that he made a comeback half a year after he retired in 2011. But this time, he's hanging the boots for real. "There will be no comeback this time," he says.</p>

      <p>Born in Salford on 16 November 1974, Paul Scholes started training with Manchester United when he was 14. After he made his professional debut in 1994, he never left and played his entire professional career for Manchester United, cementing his status as one of the key players in helping Manchester United gain so many success and trophies in the past two decades.</p>

      <p>Throughout his glorious career, he won countless trophies, scored so many memorable goals, pinged so many of his trademark long balls to wingers and forwards and gained worldwide recognition from world-class players and managers.</p>

      <p>When told about the things these top players say about him, though, Scholes refused to let them get in his head. "It is very nice to hear, very flattering," he said. "But I don't really agree. These guys have won World Cups and European Championships. I think you have to do it on the biggest stage to be considered a true great. I haven't done that."</p>
      
      <p>He may prefer not being praised or given tribute at all, but this kind of talent should be revered. A player of his kind, technically gifted and most complete in terms of footballing ability (except tackling perhaps), one-club, no celebrity bullshit, might not come along anymore.</p>
      
      <p>So again, and I can never say this enough. Thank you Paul Scholes!</p>

        <li><a href="#" class="quote" data-content="In the last 15 to 20 years the best central midfielder that I have seen — the most complete — is Scholes. I have spoken with Xabi Alonso about this many times. Scholes is a spectacular player who has everything. He can play the final pass, he can score, he is strong, he never gets knocked off the ball and he doesn’t give possession away. If he had been aish then maybe he would have been valued more." data-title="Xavi"><img src="assets/img/admirers/xavi.jpg" alt="Xavi"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#" class="quote" data-content="Very few players can do that, but Scholes is one of them - and I knew he was one of them. That's why, without question, I think Paul Scholes is the best player in England. He's got the best skills, the best brain. No one can match him. There isn't a player of his mould anywhere in the world." data-title="Alex Ferguson"><img src="assets/img/admirers/ferguson.jpg" alt="Alex Ferguson"></a></li>
        <li><a href="#" class="quote" data-content="When we were in training, I used to do a lot of tricks which hardly any players at the club could do. Once I was showing my skills to Scholes. After I finished it, Scholes took the ball and pointed to a tree which was about 50m from where we were standing. He said, I'm going to hit it in one shot. He kicked and hit the tree. He asked me to do the same; I kicked about 10 times, but still couldn't hit it. He smiled and left." data-title="Cristiano Ronaldo"><img src="assets/img/admirers/ronaldo.jpg" alt="Cristiano Ronaldo"></a></li>

        <li><a href="#" class="quote" data-content="I’d go for Scholesy as the club’s greatest ever player. I’ve seen him do things that no other player can do. The way he can control the tempo of games, and his range of passing, are both incredible. We’ve seen over the years that players just haven’t been able to get near him. And you can’t forget his goals either." data-title="Ryan Giggs"><img src="assets/img/admirers/giggs.jpg" alt="Ryan Giggs"></a></li>

There might be no knighthoods, no MBEs or OBEs, but every single team-mate will say he is the best they have ever played with. And every player he had played against, including Xavi and Zinedine Zidane, would say he is the best midfielder they have faced.
